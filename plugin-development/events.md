There are **five** events that a plugin can run: `activate`, `deactivate`, `init`, `install`, and `uninstall`. A plugin does not *need* to define any of these methods.

## Activate
Runs when the plugin is activated.

## Deactivate
Runs when the plugin is deactivated.

## Init
Runs within the main constroller, before all requests.

## Install
Runs when the plugin is installed.

## Uninstall
Runs when the plugin is uninstalled.
